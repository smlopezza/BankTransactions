# Topic Modelling of Banking Transactions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)


## Objective of the project

This is a personal project to get insights related to my personal expenses. In this notebook I analyze bank statements from my everyday banking account and my two credit cards using Topic Modelling with the idea to classiffy transactions. I also take a look on how my transactions have been affected by COVID 19.

In this notebook I am practicing my skills in:
* __Pandas__ for working with files and datasets
* __Seaborn__ and __Ploty__ to plot the different figures
* __Scikit-Learn__ - I use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (__LDA__) for analysis of the transactions description field
